machine learning and robotics

This is a tutorial how to teach machine learing principles with Teachable machine, Tensorflow and fable by shape robotics.

### How To

Fable Blockly is Python 3.8 based software in combination with Blockly by Google. To use the models made by teachable machine or other machine learning models in fable blocky python packages need to be added to the application. In this repository are all the python files or you can download them yourself.

list of packages:

!!! important that these packages are all for Python 3.8 !!!

- tensorflow 2.4.3
- numpy	1.19.2
- Pillow 7.2.0
- xml
- timeit.py

these packages should be places in the following directory:
```Fable.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/prod/app/server```
If there the files already exist in the directory keep the original files.

Windows:
Copy folder ```site-packages.zip``` to be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/19VvNa9FofgUnf4KDiEXYMXadnasbV6P_/view?usp=sharing into ```C:\Program Files\Fable\resources\app.asar.unpacked\prod\app\server``` this will copy all the required packages for the Fable 2.0.4 software to use. When presented with duplicate files select to keep the old original files.
